It is composed of four nucleotide bases\u2014adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)\u2014that pair specifically to form a double helix structure. Each segment of DNA, known as a sequence, holds vital information that can be used to code for proteins and regulate biological processes. For example, in the DNA structure of protein complex 251D, the sequence found in Chain A is TGCCAT, a short but meaningful stretch of nucleotides that could contribute to the biological function of the molecule.\n\n\\end{document}\n",
